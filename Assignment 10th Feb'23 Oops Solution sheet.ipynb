    "Answer 1. The built-in function used to open a file is open().\n",
    "The syntax for opening a file using open() function is:\n",

    "\n",
    "In the above syntax filename is the file to be opened, and mode specifies the purpose of opening the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different modes available for opening a file, as listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \"r\" (read mode): This mode is used to read data from a file. If the file does not exist, it will raise a FileNotFoundError exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \"w\" (write mode): This mode is used to write data to a file. If the file already exists, it will truncate the existing content of the file. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \"a\" (append mode): This mode is used to add data to the end of an existing file. If the file does not exist, it will create a new file.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. \"x\" (exclusive creation mode): This mode is used to create a new file, but it will raise a FileExistsError exception if the file already exists.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. \"b\" (binary mode): This mode is used to read or write binary data, such as images or audio files.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. \"t\" (text mode): This mode is used to read or write text data.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. \"+\" (update mode): This mode is used to perform both read and write operations on a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to open a file named \"test.txt\" in read mode, you can use the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "file_object = open(\"test.txt\", \"r\")"
